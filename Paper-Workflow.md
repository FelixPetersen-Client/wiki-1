For my paper writing flow, I use the following software:

* [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?sig=9cc3cab089a9f3f568386d206d09bb2a66a00f455146fb1145ce9efc27a12cb3&uid=176246923)<sup id="a1">[1](#b1)</sup>
  * Create notes about ideas, make lists, and start first formulations
  * Create tables to compare papers/literature
* [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) ([Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) as an open source alternative)
  * Just store the papers referenced to in Evernote
  * Annotate the papers using external PDF Reader (Acrobat Reader / Preview)
  * I personally **prefer** Mendeley over Zotero because it has mobile apps and 2GB instead of 300MB of free storage
* XMind ZEN ([Docear](http://www.docear.org) is older but has way more features)
  * Organize the papers w.r.t. various attributes
* [texStudio](https://www.texstudio.org) ([Overleaf v2](https://www.overleaf.com?r=a5d42ee0&rm=d&rs=b)<sup id="a2">[2](#b2)</sup> as an online alternative)
  * Write the Paper
