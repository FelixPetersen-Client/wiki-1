For my paper writing flow, I use the following software:

* Evernote
  * Create notes about ideas, make lists, and start first formulations
  * Create tables to compare papers/literature
* Mendeley (Zotero as an alternative)
  * Just store the papers referenced to in Evernote
  * Annotate the papers using external PDF Reader (Acrobat Reader / Preview)
* XMind ZEN (Docear is older but has way more features)
  * Organize the papers w.r.t. various attributes
* texStudio (ShareLaTeX as an alternative)
  * Write the Paper
